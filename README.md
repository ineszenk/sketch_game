# EPFL Extension School - Final Project 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Sketch Game

The sketching game uses [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) to make predictions about images that are drawn on a canvas element. It has been modeled-off Google's [Quick, Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#).

To challenge your drawing skills please run this commands:

### `npm install`
### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
